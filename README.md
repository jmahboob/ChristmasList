# ChristmasList
A small Flask + AngularJS based Christmas list application for my family to use this holiday season.

**In case anyone is wondering I'm using the Issues tab as a sort of "ToDo" list for the project.  I don't have some sort of split personality disorder where I'm commenting on my own work without realizing it.**
